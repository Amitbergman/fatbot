# Fat Bot
The Telegram bot that keeps you lean

This is the open sourced code for the Telegram bot that manages groups of users helping them workout.

### Getting Started
* Add `@shotersheminbot` bot to your group and give it admin permissions (it needs to ban users eventually)
* Use `/workout` to report a workout (FatBot will ask that you have a photo uploaded in the last 24 hours, or after the report)
* Use `/status` to see where you stand, when did you last workout and how long you have till getting banned (only works in a private message to the bot)

### Features
* Last day notification
* Ban user on day 0
